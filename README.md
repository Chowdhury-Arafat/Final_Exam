Dear Professor,

I have created seperate file for each Part of the Final exam. The files are named as the title of the part in the Final Exam document shared in Canvas. I also have uploaded data so that the results are reproducable. Some specific points that would help you to check the submission are listed below:

-- Part 3 have two parts (one for shiny app and for data manipulation)
-- Answer Descriptive questions (3,4,5) of Machine Learning part are written with multine comment inside the pthon script.
